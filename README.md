# Google Play Store Apps : Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Problem Statement:

Google Play Store or Play Store for Android Market, is a digital distribution service operated and developed by Google. It serves as the official app store for certified devices running on the Android. The Play Store apps data has enormous potential to drive app-making businesses to success.
